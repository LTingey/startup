**startup project for CS260: Map Your Travels**


## Elevator Pitch
Are you a big traveler but often forget all of the places you've been? With this app, you can easily keep track of every place you've traveled with an interactive map. Just select a state you have set foot in and the app will color it in. You can also add your friends and be notified when they have been to a new place. (Disclaimer: Since this is brand new, it will only be states in the U.S., but soon it will be a map of the whole world!)


## Notes
What I learned from GitHub assignment: fetch then pull and stage, commit, push
